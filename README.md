# XSS Vulnerability Scanner

A simple XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability scanner that detects Reflected and Stored XSS vulnerabilities. This lightweight tool is designed for security professionals, penetration testers, and developers to identify XSS vulnerabilities in web applications.

## üöÄ Features

### XSS Detection

- **Reflected XSS**: Detects XSS in URL parameters and form inputs that are immediately reflected
- **Stored XSS**: Identifies persistent XSS in forms where user input is stored and displayed later
- **Lightweight**: No heavy dependencies like Selenium
- **Fast Scanning**: Multi-threaded testing for speed

### Testing Capabilities

- **XSS Payloads**: Essential payload database with unique identifiers for tracking
- **Form Analysis**: Automatically detects and tests web forms
- **URL Discovery**: Simple link extraction and testing
- **Payload Verification**: Revisits pages to verify if stored payloads persist

### Performance

- **Concurrent Testing**: Multi-threaded scanning for speed
- **Configurable Threads**: Adjust scanning speed
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and recovery

### Reporting

- **JSON Reports**: Export results in JSON format
- **Console Output**: Real-time vulnerability detection feedback

## üîí Security Considerations

### Responsible Use

- ‚úÖ Only test websites you own or have explicit permission to test
- ‚úÖ Use for authorized penetration testing and bug bounty programs
- ‚úÖ Follow responsible disclosure practices
- ‚úÖ Respect rate limits and server resources

### Rate Limiting

The scanner includes built-in delays and respects server resources:

- Configurable request timeouts
- Thread limiting to prevent overwhelming servers
- Automatic backoff on errors

## üéì Educational Resources

### Understanding XSS Types

#### Reflected XSS

- Occurs when user input is immediately reflected in the response
- Common in search boxes, error messages, and form validation
- Example: `https://example.com/search?q=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
- The scanner tests GET parameters and form inputs for immediate reflection

#### Stored XSS (Persistent XSS)

- User input is stored on the server and later displayed to users
- Found in comments, user profiles, message boards, and review sections
- More dangerous as it can affect multiple users over time
- The scanner submits payloads with unique identifiers and revisits pages to verify persistence

### How Stored XSS Detection Works

1. **Identification**: Scanner identifies forms with fields likely to store data (comment, message, review, etc.)
2. **Submission**: Unique payloads are submitted to these forms
3. **Verification**: Scanner revisits the same page and related pages to check if the payload persists
4. **Detection**: If the unique payload appears on a subsequent visit, Stored XSS is confirmed

### Common Vulnerable Parameters

- Search queries: `q`, `query`, `search`, `keyword`
- User data: `name`, `email`, `comment`, `message`
- Navigation: `url`, `redirect`, `return`, `callback`
- Identifiers: `id`, `user`, `page`, `category`
- Content fields: `description`, `review`, `feedback`, `note`, `body`, `post`

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Permission Errors

- Ensure you have permission to test the target
- Check if the website blocks automated requests

### Performance Optimization

- Reduce thread count for slower servers: `--threads 3`
- Increase timeout for slow responses: `--timeout 20`
