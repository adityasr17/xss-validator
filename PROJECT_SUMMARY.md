## ✨ Key Features Implemented

### 🔍 Multi-Type XSS Detection

- **Reflected XSS**: Tests URL parameters and form inputs
- **Stored XSS**: Identifies persistent XSS in user content
- **DOM-based XSS**: Browser automation for client-side XSS

### 🌐 Advanced Discovery

- **Intelligent Crawling**: Link analysis and common path discovery
- **Subdomain Enumeration**: DNS brute force + certificate transparency
- **Form Analysis**: Automatic form detection and testing
- **Sitemap Parsing**: Extracts URLs from sitemap.xml and robots.txt

### 💥 Comprehensive Payload Testing

- **500+ XSS Payloads**: Extensive database with bypass techniques
- **Context-Aware Testing**: Different payloads for different contexts
- **WAF Bypass Methods**: Advanced evasion techniques
- **Custom Payload Support**: Load your own payload files

### 📊 Rich Reporting

- **Multiple Formats**: JSON, HTML, CSV, XML reports
- **Risk Analysis**: Vulnerability categorization and scoring
- **Visual Reports**: Professional HTML reports with styling
- **Export Options**: Easy integration with other tools

### ⚡ Performance Features

- **Concurrent Testing**: Multi-threaded scanning
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable delays to avoid overwhelming servers
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and recovery
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicators

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Quick Start

```bash
# Basic scan
python simple_xss_scanner.py -u https://example.com

# Enhanced scan with all features
python enhanced_xss_scanner.py -u https://example.com
```

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Comprehensive scan with subdomains
python enhanced_xss_scanner.py -u https://example.com \
    --subdomains \
    --depth 3 \
    --threads 10 \
    --output report \
    --format html

# Aggressive testing with custom payloads
python enhanced_xss_scanner.py -u https://example.com \
    --aggressive \
    --payloads custom_payloads.txt \
    --format json
```

### Windows Quick Commands

```cmd
# Setup
setup.bat

# Quick scan
scan.bat https://example.com --subdomains --output report --format html
```

## 🧪 Testing Results
